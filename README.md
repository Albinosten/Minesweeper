# Minesweeper

Right klick to flag as bomb.
left klick to select
R to reload a new game
P to reveal all tiles
S to save current board
L to load a saved board
N to use the solve funktion. (work in progress)

I made this game because i like Minesweeper and wanted to try writing a program that solves it.

Right now the solver is in mk2 and working kind of okey.
You have to select a few tiles before it can do its work because it cant guess when there are not enough known tiles.
